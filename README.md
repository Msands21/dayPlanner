# dayPlanner
week 03 JQuery Challenge
## Project Decscription
In this project, I built a day planner implementing moment.js and jquery to update our web app with current time and user ability to input and save to-do tasks for each time-block. Each time block changes color depending on past/present/future (for loop with conditionals). LocalStorage was used to store and grab data as well.
